# Flexul

An implementation of a simple, untyped programming language.
Currently, the project consists of two programs: the compiler and 
the interpreter. The script `run.sh` can be used to compile and
interpret a Flexul file.

Status: Early development

Currently supported test files in the `tests/` directory: 
- `func.fx`
- `fib.fx`
- `fac.fx`

Syntax may change at any time.
